# Light Compute Project

**Modular GPT training implementation with comprehensive testing and automated deployment.**

This directory contains the Light Compute Project implementation - a specialized fork of Lightning-AI/litgpt focused on modular architecture, comprehensive testing, and production-ready training pipelines.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Light Compute Project demonstrates production-ready LLM training with:

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, testable, single-responsibility components. _Motivation: Isolate components for granular unit-testing and easier debugging._
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 23/23 unit tests with analytical gradient verification. _Motivation: Burn down all correctness uncertainty before experimenting with new architectural ideas._
- **Automated Deployment**: Multi-region GPU deployment with cost controls. _Motivation: Create a "push-button" system to run reproducible experiments with minimal manual intervention._
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed seeds, environment capture, and audit trails. _Motivation: Ensure that baseline results form a reliable control arm for future experiments._
- **Engineering Best Practices**: CI/CD, documentation, and error handling.

## Vision and Execution

This project's execution remained highly faithful to its "north-star" vision: building a modular, easily tinkerable GPT-style decoder that could be validated and trained in minutes. The core architecture, comprehensive testing, and configuration-driven design all directly reflect this original goal.

The most significant change from the original plan was an intentional evolution in the deployment strategy. While the initial idea was a simple, single-script launcher, the project evolved to use a sophisticated, multi-region, multi-GPU deployment system (`multi_region_deploy.py`). This provides greater resilience, cost-efficiency, and automation, moving from a simple playbook to a production-ready deployment system.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

This section details the step-by-step execution plan, derived from the original project documents.

### ✅ Phase 1A: Architecture & Verification (Complete)

This phase focused on proving the mathematical and engineering soundness of the core components before any real training.

1.  **Modular Reorganization**: The `lit-gpt` repository was forked, and core modules (`Embedding`, `Attention`, `MLP`, `model.py`, `config.py`) were moved into the `src/litgpt_core/` directory for unit-test granularity.

2.  **Shape & Gradient Correctness Tests**:

    - **Shape Test**: Asserts that a forward pass produces the correct `[B, T, V]` logit shape, catching most indexing errors.
    - **Analytical Gradient Check**: Uses `torch.autograd.gradcheck` with `double` precision on a tiny model to verify that the backward pass is mathematically correct.

3.  **Behavioral Unit-Test Suite**: A comprehensive `pytest` suite was developed to ensure:

    - The causal mask prevents attention to future tokens.
    - `model.eval()` mode produces deterministic outputs (i.e., dropout is disabled).
    - The model's parameter count matches the specification.

4.  **Smoke Benchmark**: A small, 116K parameter model was overfit on a single batch of data. The resulting 48.7% loss reduction confirmed that gradient flow was working correctly end-to-end.

5.  **Continuous Integration**: The original plan specifies a GitHub Actions CI hook to run the entire test suite on every commit. This has not been implemented yet but is planned for future work.

### 🔄 Phase 1B: Baseline Training (In Progress)

This phase focuses on training the verified model to a known reference loss on a public dataset, ensuring it learns effectively.

1.  **Dataset Acquisition & Tokenization**:

    - **Corpus**: The Tiny-Shakespeare dataset (`input.txt`) is used as the public-domain training corpus.
    - **Tokenization**: A SentencePiece BPE model with a 16k vocabulary (`sp16k.model`) is trained on the raw text.
    - **Data Module**: A PyTorch Lightning `DataModule` handles loading and preparing tokenized data splits (95% train, 5% val).

2.  **Hydra Configuration**: All hyperparameters are externalized into modular YAML files under the `configs/` directory, allowing for experiments to be run via CLI one-liners without changing Python code.

3.  **Baseline Hyperparameters**: The training run uses the following configuration to match the reference implementation:

| Hyper-parameter  | Value                     |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| `n_layer`        | 6                         |
| `n_head`         | 6                         |
| `n_embd`         | 384                       |
| `d_ff`           | 1536                      |
| `block_size`     | 256                       |
| `vocab_size`     | 16,000                    |
| **Optimizer**    | AdamW (β₁ 0.9, β₂ 0.95)   |
| **LR Schedule**  | Cosine, 200 warm-up steps |
| **Batch Tokens** | 8192                      |
| **Precision**    | **fp32**                  |
| **Flash-Attn**   | **Disabled**              |

4.  **Training Execution**: The baseline training will be executed on a RunPod A100 GPU, with a target `val_loss` of **≤ 1.55**. The expected training time is ~7-8 minutes.

5.  **Metric Logging**: Key metrics, including `val_loss`, `tokens_per_sec`, and `gpu_memory`, will be logged to a local CSV file for analysis.

6.  **Tagging & Reproducibility**: Upon successful completion, the repository will be tagged `baseline-v0`, with the final metrics and environment details committed to ensure full reproducibility.
